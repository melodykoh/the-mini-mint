## Task: GitHub Issue #6 — Add toggle in Settings to hide/show test kids from Dashboard

### Problem
QA-Alice, QA-Bob, and TestKid clutter the Dashboard during normal use. Need a toggle to hide them.

### What to do
1. Read src/pages/Settings.tsx — understand the settings UI pattern
2. Read src/pages/Dashboard.tsx — understand how kids are rendered
3. Add a "Show test kids" toggle to Settings page (use localStorage, not the settings table — simpler, no migration)
4. In Dashboard, filter out kids whose names start with "QA-" or equal "TestKid" when the toggle is off
5. Default the toggle to ON (show all kids)

### Acceptance criteria
- New toggle appears in Settings page labeled "Show test kids"
- When OFF: Dashboard hides kids named "QA-Alice", "QA-Bob", "TestKid" (any name starting with "QA-" or matching "TestKid")
- When ON: all kids visible (current behavior)
- Toggle state persists across page reloads (localStorage)
- Other pages (Invest, History, Add Money, Spend) are NOT affected — they still work for hidden kids
- TypeScript compiles clean (npx tsc --noEmit)

### Rules
- Read all relevant files BEFORE making changes
- Use localStorage (key: "tmm_show_test_kids", values: "true"/"false")
- Keep it simple — no new components needed, just a checkbox/toggle in Settings and a filter in Dashboard
- Do not change any other behavior
- Commit when done with message referencing issue #6

When ALL acceptance criteria are met and committed, output: ISSUE 6 COMPLETE
