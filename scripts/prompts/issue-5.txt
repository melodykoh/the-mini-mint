## Task: GitHub Issue #5 — Pre-select kid when navigating from Dashboard action buttons

### Problem
When clicking "Add Money" or "Spend" from a kid's card on the Dashboard, the target page opens with NO kid selected. The user has to re-select the kid manually.

### What to do
1. Read src/pages/Dashboard.tsx — the kid card action links
2. Read src/pages/AddMoney.tsx and src/pages/Spend.tsx — how they select a kid
3. Modify the Dashboard links for "Add Money" and "Spend" to pass the kid ID (use query param or route state)
4. Modify AddMoney.tsx and Spend.tsx to read and pre-select the kid from the param/state
5. Invest and History already use /kid/:kidId/ routes — verify they work (no change needed)

### Acceptance criteria
- Clicking "Add Money" from a kid's Dashboard card leads to the kid being pre-selected on the Add Money page
- Clicking "Spend" from a kid's Dashboard card leads to the kid being pre-selected on the Spend page
- Navigating to /add-money or /spend directly (from header nav) results in no kid pre-selected (current behavior preserved)
- TypeScript compiles clean (npx tsc --noEmit)

### Rules
- Read all relevant files BEFORE making changes
- Use the simplest approach (query param ?kid=uuid or Link state)
- Do not change any other behavior
- Commit when done with message referencing issue #5

When ALL acceptance criteria are met and committed, output: ISSUE 5 COMPLETE
