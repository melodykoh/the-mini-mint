## Task: GitHub Issue #7 — Show APY rates under CD duration options on Invest page

### Problem
The CD section on the Invest page shows duration options (3-month, 6-month, 12-month) but does not show the APY for each term. Users cannot see the rate before investing.

### What to do
1. Read src/pages/Invest.tsx — find the CD section and how terms are rendered
2. The settings query is already available on the Invest page (used for stock_position_limit)
3. Display the APY next to each CD term option, e.g., "6 months — 5.0% APY"
4. Settings keys: cd_3m_apy, cd_6m_apy, cd_12m_apy (stored as decimals, e.g., 0.05 = 5.0%)

### Acceptance criteria
- Each CD term option displays its current APY percentage (e.g., "3 months — 4.8% APY")
- APY values come from the settings query (cd_3m_apy, cd_6m_apy, cd_12m_apy)
- Display format: multiply by 100, one decimal place (e.g., 0.048 becomes "4.8%")
- If settings have not loaded yet, show term without APY (no "undefined%" or NaN)
- TypeScript compiles clean (npx tsc --noEmit)

### Rules
- Read the entire CdSection in Invest.tsx BEFORE making changes
- Minimal change — just add APY display text, do not restructure the section
- Do not change any other behavior
- Commit when done with message referencing issue #7

When ALL acceptance criteria are met and committed, output: ISSUE 7 COMPLETE
